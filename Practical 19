/*
Write a Java program to model a college admission system using the concept of inner classes.
Create an outer class named College that stores the collegeName as a data member and
initializes it through a constructor. Within the College class, define a non-static inner class
named Admission that contains student-specific details such as the studentName and the
course they are enrolling in. The inner class should have methods to accept and display
student information, and it should also be able to access and display the collegeName stored
in the outer class. In the main method, create an object of the College class by passing the
collegeName, and then use this object to create an instance of the inner Admission class.
Invoke appropriate methods to input the student’s name and course, and then display the
complete admission details, including the college name.
