/*
Develop a Java application that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI). The program
should ask the user for their weight in pounds and height in inches. Convert these values to
kilograms and meters respectively (1 pound = 0.45359237 kg, 1 inch = 0.0254 meters) and
then calculate BMI (weight in kg / (height in meters) ^2). Display the calculated BMI.
